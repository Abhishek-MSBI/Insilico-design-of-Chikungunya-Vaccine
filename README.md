# Multi-Epitope Vaccine Design Against Chikungunya Virus

This project presents a detailed **in silico** design and simulation of a multi-epitope subunit vaccine against the Chikungunya virus. It uses **immunoinformatics, structural bioinformatics**, and **molecular dynamics** to construct a stable, antigenic, and non-allergenic chimeric protein suitable for experimental validation.
